# Custom-Java-Comparable-Interface
A class called Food that implements the Java Comparable interface. The class contains fields for the manufacturer, the food name, and the price. Includes an appropriate constructor that sets all 3 fields. Includes a toString() method to indicate how the object appears on the screen when passed that object to println(). Also there is a program called TestFood.java that creates an array of 5 instances of Food. It populates this array by reading in information from a file called “food-input.txt”. Each line of the file is in the following order: Manufacturer, Name, and Price. It prints the contents of the Food array, each element on its own line to an output file named “food-output.txt”. After printing the unsorted elements, it prints to the output file the text “SORTED: “ on its own line. Then sorts the array, using sort() from the Arrays class, and prints the contents of the array again to the end of that output file, each element on its own line.
